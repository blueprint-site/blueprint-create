# Blueprint-create
A site that has most of the Create Mod addons (if not all of them). Currently scanning Modrinth and Curseforge

### Tech stack
Site uses Appwrite for backend. And Vite with react and typescript for frontend

### v2.0.1
This version adapts previous code that was used in v2 (see `v2-old-archive`) but simplifies and removes some features. A lot of code has been written by me (i mostly ported the useAddons.ts because it worked well in v2)

### Contributors
This verion (v2.0.1) has been rewritten with code snippets there were previously on the v2 branch. It has been largely made by:
- spencerfrost
- timiliris
Parts of this version have been copied and modified from the previous release. Huge thanks for You guys, without your work v2 wouldn't have been possible. Reading Your code i learnt a lot, and now im using that code to make Blueprint even better. Sadly i cant attribute all individual code lines, but it should be visible in the `v2-old-archive` branch.
