# Blueprint-create
A site that has most of the Create Mod addons (if not all of them). Currently scanning Modrinth and Curseforge

### Tech stack
Site uses Appwrite for backend. And Vite with react and typescript for frontend.

### Contributing & rules
You are free to open a pull request with code you want to edit! But there is a rule:
Do **not** vibecode code. You can use AI but do not let your favourite AI agent go on and do everything for you.
We do not guarantee that your pr will be approved.

### Acknowledgements
This version couldn't be possible without timiliris and spencerfrost. They made a lot of contributions to the v2 codebase and without them Blueprint would not be the same! Also huge thanks to all contributors that contributed their time and work to Blueprint!
